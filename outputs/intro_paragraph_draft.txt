Cultures consistently comprised a mixture of motile and stationary cells.
Across the key timepoints (0/1/4 d), average culture composition shifted gradually, but motility persisted, consistent with a steady rather than abrupt decline.
Higher settlement counts tended to occur in cultures with higher motility fractions, supporting the encounter-driven view that motile spores more often reach and attach to surfaces.
